Welcome to my very first blog post! I've mulled over the idea of writing a blog for well over a decade now. I've taken small bites of blogging, shuttled them back and forth in my mouth, but I've never been quite satisfied with the taste or texture. Sometimes it's the words themselves. Other days it's the medium they are written on. Somewhere underneath all of that there's a voice that's yet to be realized.

I finally feel like I've been around the block, like I've lived long enough to have a coherent perspective. I know my younger self would have said the same thing, and he would've been wrong too. The more you come to know, the more you find that you don't know anything at all. Today is no exception to that rule, and yet, there is something more complete present within me. There's less grasping, less arrogant determination. There's significantly more humility.

I think each of us has to find our voice. Each of us has to endure the agony of heartbreak, over and over again until we become tender like green shoots reaching for the light of early spring. At some point we truly learn the cost of trampling that precious new growth, and we begin to walk with grace, we begin to watch over the death of so much internal ugliness.
